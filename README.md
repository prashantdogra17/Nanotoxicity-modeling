# Nanotoxicity-modeling

This repository hosts a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to evaluate 18 traditional ML models for binary classification of nanoparticle induced organ toxicity. The pipeline leverages all available data features and employs a rigorous 10-fold nested cross-validation approach to optimize hyperparameters and obtain unbiased performance estimates.

Key Features:
- Multi-Model Evaluation: Implements and compares 18 traditional machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Machines, and more.
- Nested Cross-Validation: Utilizes 10-fold nested cross-validation to ensure robust model assessment and mitigate overfitting during hyperparameter tuning.
- Full Feature Utilization: Incorporates all available data features for a comprehensive analysis of nanoparticle induced organ toxicity.
- Reproducibility: Structured pipeline for reproducible experiments, ensuring consistent results across different runs.
